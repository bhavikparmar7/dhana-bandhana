---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **NestJS** (TypeScript)
* **TypeORM** for PostgreSQL
* **Mongoose** for MongoDB
* **Firebase Admin SDK** for token verification
* **AWS SDK (S3)** for file management

### MongoDB Atlas

* Stores raw files data uploaded by user
* Stores raw transaction data parsed by the processor

### PostgreSQL (RDS)

* Finalized, normalized transactions for reports and analytics
* SQL-friendly queries and schema enforcement
